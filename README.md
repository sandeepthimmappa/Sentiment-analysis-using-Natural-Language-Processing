# Sentiment-analysis-using-Natural-Language-Processing
**NLP (Natural Language Processing) with Python.Using labelled score 1 (for positive) or 0 (for negative) will train machine learning model to learn to discriminate between 1/0 automatically**


We'll be using a dataset from the UCI datasets! The dataset contains sentences labelled with positive or negative sentiment.

Details:

Score is either 1 (for positive) or 0 (for negative)
The sentences come from three different websites/fields:

imdb.com
amazon.com
yelp.com

For each website, there exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly for larger datasets of reviews.
We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or negative connotaton, the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
